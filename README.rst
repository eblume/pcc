facade is a programming syntax and grammer, as well as a preprocessor
(written in Python) which converts facade programs in to equivalent ANSI C
programs.

For an example of facade syntax, see 'example.fc' in this directory.

To preprocess a facade file in to an equivalent ANSI C file, run the program
'facade'. This executable reads facade files in from STDIN and prints equivalent
ANSI C programs to the STDOUT, and currently does not support any options or
arguments.
